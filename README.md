# homebrew-python
üçª Python formulae for the missing package manager for macOS

## Overview
This tap supports Python 3.6 and marks 3.7 as in development, as it is still cutting edge and filled with broken modules at this time.

## Plans
I plan to build this tap to hold multiple versions of python so one could switch to a different minor version at will.

## Installation
```sh
brew tap alexgurrola/python
brew install alexgurrola/python/python
```

## Feedback
Use the issue tracker for any requests, bugs, etc.  Thanks!
